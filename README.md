# SubredditSimulator

This is the code behind [/r/SubredditSimulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditSimulator), an automated subreddit populated by bots making submissions and comments, primarily using markov chains based on the actual posts in other subreddits.

## Disclaimer

This project is deliberately somewhat difficult to get running (requiring reading of the code and undocumented, manual configuration of some things). Markov chain bots can be hilarious, but they also have the potential to be annoying to real users if released "into the wild", so it is not my intention to make it extremely simple for anyone to start running similar bots.

## Suggestions/discussion/etc.
